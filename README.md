# Master Ball Game
 
Summary
This is a game I created, written in C# using the Unity engine.

Description
This is a game where you are a ball placed on a platform. Your mission is to stay on the platform for as long as possible. However, there's a catch. There will be enemies coming at you making it harder for you to stay on the platform. The enemies will come in waves of increasing difficulty. Each waves there will be more enemies and depending on your stage, a boss might spawn. There are 3 different powerups that randomly spawns on the platform to help you beat your enemies and knock them off the platform. 

Installation:

If you simply wants to try out the game, then follow this link to my game on itch.io: https://quangle28.itch.io/master-ball

If you want to modify or test out different settings in my game, there are a couple steps that needs to be done:

1. Download Unity Hub 
2. Go to the Install tab in Unity Hub and download the Unity version of 2020.3.X with Long Term Support (LTS)
3. Download the Prototype 4 folder from my main project page 
4. Go to the Projects tab in Unity and click the dropdown arrow next to Open and choose 'Add project from disk'
5. Upload the Prototype 4 file you downloaded 
6. Open the file on Unity Hub 
7. Enjoy looking at the settings and mechanisms of the game 

Usage:
If you decided to play the game on itch.io, there will be an instruction tab for you to learn about the controls and different mechanisms of the game. There will also be a settings tab that you can use to control ingame sound effect and audio.
